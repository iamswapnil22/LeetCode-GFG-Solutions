# DP ON TREES
        Dynamic Programming (DP) on trees is used to optimize solutions to tree-related problems by storing and reusing results of subproblems, avoiding redundant computations. It is particularly helpful when dealing with queries about subtrees or paths in a tree, as it allows for efficient memoization and breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.

### Diameter:
    The diameter of a tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The path is measured by the number of edges between the nodes.

### Problems

1. Diameter of Binary Tree: Find the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a binary tree.

2. Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree: Calculate the maximum sum of a path in a binary tree. The path may start and end at any node.

3. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum II: Similar to the maximum path sum, but the path must go from the root to a leaf.

4. Counting Binary Trees with Given Constrained Sum: Count the number of binary trees with a given sum and satisfying certain constraints.

5. Maximum Independent Set in Binary Tree: Find the size of the largest set of nodes in a binary tree such that no two nodes in the set are adjacent.

6. Binary Tree Cameras: Place cameras in a binary tree to monitor all nodes with the minimum number of cameras.

7. Optimal Binary Search Tree: Construct a binary search tree with minimum cost given the frequencies of the keys.
